# 🚀 EgyID

## Overview 📝

The **EgyID** is a Java-based application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to generate unique Egyptian IDs, manage personal information, and save them in a CSV file. The application features a simple yet intuitive GUI where users can input details like name, gender, religion, and more, upload a profile image, generate an ID, and **edit the ID** if necessary before saving it.

### Features ✨
- **🔑 Generate ID**: Automatically generates a unique Egyptian ID based on the user's details (name, gender, religion, occupation, etc.).
- **📝 Edit ID**: After generating the ID, users can choose to **edit** the details before confirming and saving the ID.
- **📸 Upload Image**: Users can upload a profile image to accompany their ID.
- **💾 Save to CSV**: The generated IDs and their details are saved to a CSV file for future reference.
- **❌ Duplicate Check**: Ensures that no duplicate IDs are generated by checking existing IDs in the CSV file.
- **💻 GUI Interface**: The user-friendly interface allows for easy input, ID generation, image upload, and output display.

## Prerequisites 🧰

Before running the application, make sure you have:

- **☕ Java JDK** (version 8 or higher)
